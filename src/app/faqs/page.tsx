        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'For most homes in New Jersey, we recommend pressure washing once a year to remove built-up dirt, mold, and mildew. However, homes in heavily wooded areas or those near water may benefit from cleaning twice a year.'

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: "No, high-pressure washing isn't suitable for all surfaces. We use soft washing techniques for delicate surfaces like roofs, vinyl siding, and painted surfaces to prevent damage while still achieving excellent cleaning results."

    question: "Do you use the customer's water?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we typically use the customer's water supply. We connect to your outdoor spigot using our professional-grade equipment."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you have a water tank if you don't bring your own water?",
    answer:
      'Our water tanks serve to feed our hungry machines. In many instances, a water source is not able to keep up with the demand of our machines, this allows us to continue uninterrupted.'
  },
  {
    question:
      "What's the difference between soft washing and pressure washing?",
    answer:
      'Soft washing uses lower pressure and specialized cleaning solutions for delicate surfaces, while pressure washing uses high-pressure water for tough stains on durable surfaces.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I prepare my property before service?',
    answer:
      'Please remove any valuable items, close all windows and doors, and ensure easy access to the areas that need cleaning.'
